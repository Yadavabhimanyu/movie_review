# Hello and Welcome !.
## The aim of this project is to provide users a real time movie review ,based on the latest tweets or trends. This project has been developed as a POC.


- __A brief explaination about the methodlogy used:-__
   - The model has been trained on the IMDB dataset available on Kaggle.
   - The model uses Twitter API i.e. tweepy to fetch tweets that mentions the given movie/topic.
   - After the tweets has been fetched and stored, the data is then pre-processed for the model.
   - The model then predicts the outcome as categories i.e positive or negative ,then the percenatge of people having either positive or negative review is calcuated.


- __Task performed:-__
The classical Machine Learning task like data exploration,feature engineering,model buiding, model testing,Hyperparameters tuning etc.
- __Deployment:-__
The model has been deployed using Heroku Cloud application platform where Github is used for version control.
- __Model:-__
Model used here is Logistic Regression.
- __Accuracy:-__
The model has a prediction accuracy greater than 88.00%.
