Hello and Welcome !.
The aim of this project is to provide users a real time movie review ,based on the latest tweets or trends. This project has been developed as a POC.


A brief explaination about the methodlogy used:-
The model has been trained on the IMDB dataset available on Kaggle.
The model uses Twitter API i.e. tweepy to fetch tweets that mentions the given movie/topic.
After the tweets has been fetched and stored, the data is then pre-processed for the model.
The model then predicts the outcome as categories i.e positive or negative ,then the percenatge of people having either positive or negative review is calcuated.


Task performed:-
The classical Machine Learning task like data exploration,feature engineering,model buiding, model testing,Hyperparameters tuning etc.
Deployment:-
The model has been deployed using Heroku Cloud application platform where Github is used for version contro.
Model:-
Model used here is Logistic Regression.
Accuracy:-
The model has a prediction accuracy greater than 88.00%.
